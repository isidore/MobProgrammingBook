# Not Just Programming

A lot of times because of the term Mob Programming includes the word programming, people wrongly assume that is about the programming. It is actually about the mobbing. You can have mob programming, mob testing, mob designing, mob writing, mob anything. A lot of times we just refer to this under the generic term mobbing. In this book, however, we will often use the term mob programming to be distinctive to the method. Please do not limit this process to programming and feel free to substitute which ever word you desire for programming.

TL;DR: It's really **Mob** <u>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  (insert activity) &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  </u>
