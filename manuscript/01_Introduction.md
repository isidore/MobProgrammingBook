# How to use this book

This is a recipe book for how to create a great and collaborative mob. Too often, we find people altering the recipes before they know how the overall dynamics work or what purpose each ingredient provides. Here is our suggestion.

## Beginner mode

In the beginning follow each step very specifically. Some of them will seem weird, counterintuitive or just wrong. Don't worry about that yet. While many people need 20-40 iterations in this mode, before they are ready to advance. We highly suggest you do a minimum of five times before advancing. This will give you a foundation to build on.

## Intermediate mode

As the mob starts to connect and a whole team emerges, you will start to move in a direction uniquely your own. At this stage, focus on the purpose of each step and start to play with the variations suggested in this book and the variations that come up from your own team. Go slowly. Try to vary only one or two things per session.

## Advanced mode

Disregard the steps. Just turn up the good. Pay attention to subtleties of your team and the lessons of the retrospectives. At this point, the book has served its purpose and is only here to remind you of some of the foundational principles. Now is the time to create your own way of working together.
