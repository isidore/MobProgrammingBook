# Attribution for work done in a mob

When a group of people works together, it becomes difficult to identify what was the contribution of each of the members. Like with baking a cake, you cannot identify if it is the flour, the sugar, the eggs or the vanilla sugar that makes the recipe just right and perfect. People inspire one another, build on one another and create together things they would not create alone.

We hope these ideas help you work out how to figure out giving credit where credit is due, without overemphasizing a mob visitors' contributions.

## Best ideas win when you care about work over credit

We often advice people who work in mobs to think of the work in terms of collaborative crediting. When you care about the work over credit, that is how you get the best ideas to win.

Many times you get credit for an idea. We think of this as a wrong way of looking at it. Instead of ideas, implementing those ideas in creative ways is where value is created. Attributing a piece of software to the architect over the developer implementing the reality of the vision would not be the right approach.

In a mob, we seek that everyone is either learning or contributing. Learning is something that stays with you when you leave the mob. Contribution is something you share with people you mobbed with, that is a product of its time where fair attribution and remembering it realistically is important.

## This book as a case example

This book started off as collaborative writing effort. Writing in strong-style, Maaret created first materials into the book with Llewellyn Falco. Every line to a certain point was written by two authors, and early versions of the book reflected this.

The two authors went their separate ways, forking the book, each keeping what was created together: the text. A book is more than the text. Llewellyn has attribution for contributing to an early skeleton. Like a visitor in a mob, the book as it will be when finished, shows pieces of his contribution, but has moved forward.  

The book is more than the text. It is the marketing site Maaret holds within LeanPub. It is the people finding the book through promotions. In the LeanPub way, it is not the text of one day, but the text towards the vision of a finalized product.

The container for the vision of the text is one that Maaret holds and takes forward.

## People crave recognition

No matter what we do, we crave for recognition for our contributions. Mobbing makes us worried that our personal impact cannot be identified. Instead, we need to collaboratively credit a group creating something together that none would have created alone.

We seek recognition to a point where we make collaboration and realistic perception of reality difficult. A famous example is identifying 12 types of dinosaurs based on fossiles. Later, a researcher asked a relevant question: "Why are there no baby dinosaurs?" only to discover that 5/12 identified types were actually younger versions of the same types. Finding a new allowed you to name it, and credit yourself for it. Finding the same was adding to the previous researchers pool.
