# Working in Your First Mob

## Preparing the navigator

Part of having a good mobbing experience is being able to have a clear direction that is shared throughout the team. A few little tricks can be done to enable this to happen as it is not a habit most people have acquired yet. 

Ask the navigator what they are going to do. Here's some examples of when a navigator has a clear direction versus when they are lost. 

Lost:

**Q**: What are you going to do?  
**A**: I don't know.   
**A**: Something with the test.   
**A**: Get it to work.   
**A**: The next scenario.   
**A**: (stares blankly)

Has direction: 

**Q**: What are you going to do?  
**A**: The code does not compile. We need to fix that.  
**A**: We need to write the test for handling positive numbers.  
**A**: I'd like to give that paragraph a better name.  
**A**: We haven't checked in in a while.  

Sometimes you can get to a direction through a series of questions. For example:

**Q**: What are you going to do next?  
**A**: I don't know.   
**Q**: Does the code work?  
**A**: No.  
**Q**: Why?  
**A**: It doesn't compile.   
**Q**: Why not?  
**A**: The class does not exist.   
**Q**: What are you going to do next?  
**A**: We need to create the class. 

### Examples

If you are working on a task or doing test-first development, it is very useful to have an example written on a whiteboard. The examples should be very simple, and only show one path at a time. This means of conditional words like "or" or "if". If there is an example, it might take many turns before its finished, and having it on the board will give guidance for the whole team on what they need to do. 

## Consume first

It is extremely beneficial to use the consume first style of programming. This allows the group to have a clear idea on where we are going and what is needed. Let's look at two examples to show how this works.

## Yes, and... 

When working as a mob, it is important to follow the Yes, and... -rule of improv. The idea here is not to delete and undo what the previous navigators did before you. You can refactor but do not rewrite. This allows progress to be made continually and prevents people from being shut down in the group. 

## Intentional code

## Small steps

## The Rules

(todo) Kindness, Consideration and Respect

#### Heuristic

If everything is going right, rotation will not disrupt the direction which the mob is going.
