# What is Mob Programming

>All the brilliant people working on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, on the same computer. -- Woody Zuill (the discoverer of Mob Programming)

Mob Programming is a style of programming in which the entire team sits together and works on a single problem at a time. Teams that have worked this way have found that many of the problems that plague normal development have just melted away, possibly because communication and learning goes way up. Teams also find that the quality of their code increases, but best part of all is that teams end up happier and more cohesive.
