# When People Get Stuck

There are times in the mob when the person who is navigating will not know what to do. Here are some strategies to deal with that situation.

## Situation 1 - navigator is confused

If you're with a new group, and the navigator is confused and maybe a little bit scared, the best thing to do is to ask the rest of the mob to help them out. This allows progress to continue, and makes people feel comfortable being exposed during that short formative period. It also allows things to go back to the designated navigator as soon as things become unconfused.

## Situation 2 - only one person knows what to do

Sometimes you'll have only one person who has any idea how to do the task at hand. In these situations, keep the rotation but allow that person to continue navigating, effectively removing the designated navigator. Also, when the single expert would rotate to the keyboard, rotate twice so that they are skipped. We want to avoid thinking at the keyboard.

This situation should not persist for long. Maybe an hour or two. But then the knowledge should be starting to pick up with other people in the circle. At every chance to you that someone else might be able to do even a little piece of the puzzle, you should facilitate pausing the expert to allow other people to start filling the role of navigator.

## Situation 3 - purposefully transferring knowledge

When you have a team that is mobbing, it is good to practice improving the underdeveloped navigation skills in your team. A good way to do this is to do a navigate the navigator -session.

In this session, the more experienced navigators will purposely pull back from navigating. They will guide the navigator through the use of questions and high level concepts.

For example, instead of laying out the steps of unit testing, they might instead ask "Have you thought about writing a test?". They might even get more direct and say "Please write a test". But they are simply getting the navigator to navigate the driver. They are never navigating the driver themselves.

## Situation 4 - opting out

Sometimes it is a good idea to allow people to opt out of a mob. Sometimes it is a bad idea to allow people to opt out. Here are our overall suggestions.

Don't start by allowing people to opt out. New things are always a bit scary. By allowing people to opt out before you even start, you make the situation more scary. When everybody is just doing things, it's what everyone does. If only some are doing it, now you have to be brave and volunteer.

When you start, put everyone in the circle, get the timer quick and don't offer the option of backing out. After they've taken their turn a couple of times, then you might want to offer the option of opting out.

There are two ways of opting out. One is they are not in the room. This method is useful only if the person opting out is having a very negative impact on the rest of the mob. While opting out might allow the rest of the mob to function well, it rarely allows people not in the room to improve. Sometimes, however, the social aspect of the rest of the mob talking and laughing together, will draw people who opted out back into the mob.  

The other way of opting out is being in the room but not be part of the mob. Think of this as being part of the audience, observing the mob. The important thing here is to make it welcoming to them when they are ready to join.

Also realize that sometimes people are just full. They need a small break some of what they have just experienced. Again, make it easy for them to rejoin as they are ready.
