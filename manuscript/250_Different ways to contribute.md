# Different ways to contribute

There are a lot of different ways of contributing in a mob. In this section we want to list some of the many ways we have observed contributions in a mob. This is not a complete nor thorough list. There are many ways, small and large, that each participant can contribute.

We hope that this list helps you to see more of the pieces that everyone is contributing and maybe helps someone recognize what they are bringing when they may otherwise feel out of place.

## Information search

You know you're going to need a piece of information in 5-10 minutes that no one in the mob has. Googling this so that you have it for the mob when they need it really helpful. This is usually done on a personal laptop or phone. It may look like you're mentally stepping away from the mob, but only briefly.  

## Bring someone in

You realize that someone who is not in the mob has information or decision power that is helpful to do the task at hand. Going and getting that person, or remotely contacting them so that they can temporarily join the mob as needed. This really helps the mob from being blocked.

## Contribute ideas

Having a good idea and knowing how to implement it are not the same thing. Both are important and they take different amounts of time. A lot of times the sparks of the idea get forgotten and credit is assigned to a single person but this is rarely the reality.

## Contributing bad ideas

Getting to a good idea may be through bad ideas. These ideas move us forward and help us recognize what the good idea looks like.

## History

Most projects have history that is easy to forget. A valuable contribution can be remembering the history. This history can warn you of dangers you've forgotten or inform you of assets you did not realize you had.

## Empathy in the mob

It's easy to slip in the bad habits, and there's some people that help us to show the better side of ourselves. These actions help to create an environment of kindness, consideration and respect. This is something that takes real effort and is sometimes taken for granted.

## Patience

It is easy to get frustrated when trying to solve a problem or when a mistake is made. Patience helps us to persist. It also helps us to have safety when learning or struggling.

## Impatience

It can be easy to get stuck in the weeds. Having someone remind us to focus and keep moving can be very helpful.

## Customer voice

We're building things for people yet often we see ourselves as separate from our users. Bringing the customer viewpoint helps make better products.

## Noticing feelings

Feeling alone is easy even in a mob. We're also in an industry that wants us to suppress our feelings. Having someone acknowledge and support how you are feeling and doing the emotional labor with you can turn a bad day around.
