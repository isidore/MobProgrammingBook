# Building habits

Now that you´ve gotten started with your first mob, the most important thing is to keep going. As the saying goes: "The best exercise is the one you do". As a coach or facilitator, you are trying to build habits. Habits take time and repetition to form. As such, there are many good intentions, that get in the way of forming habits. Heres what we´ve learned to avoid and nurture.

## End happy

No matter how good a workout may be, if you are exhausted, you don´t want to show up the next day. One of your primary goals as a facilitator should be to end while you´re still happy so that everyone wants to show up tomorrow. Try to limit sessions to two hours in the beginning for this reason. Also be very careful about running overtime, especially when overtime means staying late after work or missing lunch. You don´t want anyone saying "oh great, we´re mobbing again. I´m going to be late picking up my kids".

There are two big things that prevent people from ending on time. The first is forgetting to leave enough time for the retrospectives. The second is working in too big of chunks, so you feel uncomfortable leaving the task in such a stage of incompleteness.

Also, look for natural endpoints that might come a bit early. It could be better to end 20 minutes early at a good place.

## Learning to mob

Another common distraction on the way to learning how to be a functioning mob, is to place too much importance on being productive. While we highly encourage you to do actual production work, don´t worry about being too productive in the beginning. The first few sessions people need to learn to work together. It can be easy to forget that people have had 10-20 years of practice working by themselves and only a few hours of practice working together as a mob. Give yourself permission to slow down while learning a new skill.

Too often people feel stressed and overburdened. Because of this, they don´t allow themselves enough time to learn new skills, and improve. Because they are not improving, they continue to feel stressed and overburdened with no time to improve. It is an unfortunately common trap.

## Timing

A lot of time people will try out new things like mobbing saying "let´s try it every other week for a few hours". It is very hard to build any habits doing something only twice a month. If you are going to spend 8 hours mobbing, it is better to spend 1 hour over 8 days than 8 hours on one day. Also remember that rest is a very important factor. You want to have a little bit of learning, a little bit of rest.
