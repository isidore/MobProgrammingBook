# How to use this book

This is a recipe book for how to create a highly functional and collaborative
mob. There are two main recipes in this book.

-   Facilitating a new mob

-   Growing a long-term mob

Quite often, we find people altering the recipes before they know how the
overall dynamics work or what purpose each ingredient provides. Here is our
suggestion.

The recipes are for how to work with your groups. How closely you adhere to
these recipes should be connected to your experience as a mob facilitator.

## Beginner facilitator

If you are a beginning mob facilitator, follow each step very specifically. Some
of them will seem weird, counterintuitive or just wrong. Don't worry about that
yet. Many facilitators need 20-40 iterations in this mode before they are ready
to advance. You may need less. However, we suggest you do a minimum of five
times before advancing. This will give you a foundation to build on.

## Intermediate facilitator

Once you have facilitated a mob many times, you will start to get a sense of
what is needed and what each part contributes. You will start to move in a
direction that is uniquely yours. At this stage, focus on the purpose of each
step and start to play with the variations suggested in this book and the
variations that come up from your own team. Go slowly. Try to vary only one or
two things per session.

## Advanced facilitator

Disregard the steps. Just pay attention to the things that are working for you
and focus on doing more of those things. Pay attention to subtleties of your
team and the lessons of the retrospectives. At this point, the book has served
its purpose and is only here to remind you of some of the foundational
principles. Now is the time to create your own way of working together.
