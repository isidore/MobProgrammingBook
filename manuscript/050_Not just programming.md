Not Just Programming
====================

A lot of times because the term Mob Programming includes the word programming,
people wrongly assume that it is about programming. It is actually about the
mobbing. You can have mob programming, mob testing, mob designing, mob writing,
mob anything. A lot of times we just refer to this under the generic term
mobbing. In this book, however, we will often use the term mob programming to be
distinctive to the method. Please do not limit this process to programming and
feel free to substitute whichever word you desire for programming.

TL;DR: It's really **Mob** _______ (insert activity) _______
