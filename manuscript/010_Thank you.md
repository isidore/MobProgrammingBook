**To the person reading this book in progress,**

We wanted to say thank you. Please enjoy and give us feedback on both what you liked and didn't to help us further grow the book.

Creating a book takes a lot persistence and support from early adopters like yourself helps us to keep going.

Thank you.

We started writing this book with the idea that every line of it would be written strong-style with Llewellyn Falco. It was true for the first part. Thank you Llewellyn for your contributions in the pair that grew beyond one pair. Like all visitors in mobs, we remember your contribution and appreciate it as getting the best out of people into the work we were doing.
