**To the person reading this book in progress,**

Thank you. For reading this, for considering the ideas we share. Please enjoy and give us feedback on what you liked, what you didn't like and what you feel is still missing so that the guidebook would answer your questions. We believe the book is useful as it is, but it is work in progress that will further grow.

Creating a book takes a lot of persistence and support from early adopters like yourself helps us to keep going. The motivational impact of an email saying someone purchased the book is essential, just as seeing the numbers of interested people grow.

Thank you.

This book started off with an idea of strong-style pair writing. For every idea we would want to write down, there would be another person reviewing and improving the idea as it flowed through second person on the keyboard. The first partial versions of the book were created this way, Llewellyn Falco contributing with me. Thank you Llewellyn for your contributions that helped me shape the idea of the book. The book grew beyond as as a pair, and your role turned into a visitor in a mob. Readers of the book should know that you've helped shape the beginnings of the book. I appreciate your contributions as getting the best out of people into the work we were doing.
