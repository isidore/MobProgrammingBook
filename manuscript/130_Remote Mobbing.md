# Remote Mobbing

Remote mobbing is much harder than regular mobbing. We don't suggest it as the way to start. However, sometimes it is the only choice you have.

It will require screen sharing tools (see Reference 3). 

There are three different models of remote mobbing. We will outline all of them.

## The Remote Employee

In the remote employee model, most of the team is colocated with one member being remote. Sometimes this member is always remote, and sometimes this member is part-time remote. In this situation, the best starting point is to learn to mob colocated. And later extend it remote with the remote employee always skipping the keyboard. This is quite possible once everyone has learned the navigation skills. We also suggest you use the video setup mentioned below.

## The Remote Company

In this model, everyone on a team is located in a separate place. There is no company office and there is no chance to learn mobbing colocated. In this model, you will be using screen sharing software that allows for the change of the control of the keyboard. It is also useful to include the use of a mob timer (See reference 2). An odd advantage of this model, is that while everyone is at a disadvantage, they are all at the same disadvantage. Remember to keep your rotation short. Be extra careful that the driver is not thinking. Also, remember to take time for retrospectives and video chat.

## The Remote Team

In this model, half of the team is located somewhere and the other half is located in a different spot. The key here is to set up the mob timer so that at any given time, the designated navigator and driver are **not** located in the same spot. The reason for this is to force communication between the two groups. It is too easy for a group talking amongst themselves not to be heard by the other group. And unfortunately, we have too much practice not paying attention on a conference call. In this model, we again suggest use of a mob timer (See reference 2) and setting up an external video system mentioned below.

## Video

The question of video is a tricky one. In general there is not much gained from having video on, especially when it is just your face looking at the screen. The teams that have reported success with video, have a separate computer that is sharing the video and taking the picture. The advantage of this is most of the time you are not looking at the video. When somebody turns their head, you get to pick up many non-verbal signals that the person wants to talk to you.
