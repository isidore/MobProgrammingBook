# Full team engagement

When you're learning to mob, you need to have a designated navigator so that you can learn the skill of how to talk. If you don't do this, you will naturally isolate the more quiet people in your team. Then they will not learn to express themselves and not be able to keep up. Once you learn how communicate your ideas on tasks and code to another person you want to move from a single navigator to an entire team contributing at the same time.

Here are some of the changes to introduce as you move towards full team engagement.

## No designated navigator

This means that you don't need someone standing up while they're doing navigation. The only position that is actually relevant is the driver. This is a very short period of transition and after a little bit of that I will introduce...

## The mob timer

The mob timer is a program that not only tracks the amount of time, but also who is supposed to be at the keyboard. Once you have a mob timer, you no longer need to rotate seats. And when you don't rotate seats, the concept of the designated navigator becomes even more blurry. This frees everybody to focus on the code instead of their turn.

For a list of Mob Timers checkout the **Mob Timers** Reference in the back of the book.

## Encouraging participation

Many times multiple people will have differing ideas on how to do something. When you have a designated navigator, this isn't so much a problem because the navigator gets to decide. But once you've moved to a full mob, you are going to have to facilitate. The first rule is to encourage action. As they say in agile, **Don't discuss something for 20 minutes that you can do in 10.** As quickly as possible, try to get to doing something.

However, you also want to encourage everyone in the mob to contribute. Quieter and more introverted people will easily let go of their ideas and not fight for them. The best way to encourage all ideas to stay present is to do multiple solutions. If Sally and Tim have a way to solve a problem, try one first then the other. Afterwards decide which one was best. You get very different conversations with hindsight than you do beforehand. Sometimes what results is that one of them won't work. Sometimes a third or fourth way might present itself. This is ok, do all four.

In the beginning, it is important to try each one so that everybody knows they can be heard. After you've done that a few times, people will start to trust that they can be heard and then it is ok to confirm after the first one that you still want to do the second. It is surprising how often you will get the response "Who cares, it works". It is important that you establish trust and safety so that this comes from a place about the code and not defeat. But there are other things to do to guard against team members feeling defeated.

### Preference the weird and the quiet

A good way to encourage participation and learning is to preference people who speak less. If one of your team members rarely speaks and they speak, try their way first. Also, if one of the ways sounds very weird, preference that. This gives people courage to speak up and sets the habit of stepping outside your common routines.  

### Avoiding decision paralysis

There are two ways that people tend to get stuck. One is when into the vastness of a large open space. Think of this as you're staring at a blank page. There's so many different things. Where do you even start? It is very easy to get caught up in the abstract concepts and if you find your team stalled, what you need to do is get them to focus on a specific task.

Almost always an example is the right thing to do right now. Even if it is the wrong example, its failure can help you figure out what success looks like. Choose a path and go.

Conversely, you can also get tied up in the details. What is the perfect shade of red? Is it #ff0000 or is it #ee0000? Have you considered #dd0000? Or even #ed0000? People can spend an absurdly long amount of time talking about these types of details. This is normally referred to as bike-shedding. The term comes from a saying "If you give people plans for a nuclear power plant, they will look at it and think it is ok. But if you give them plans for a bike shed, they will argue for days about the color of the paint." Although this paralysis is the exacts opposite of looking into the vastness, the solution is still the same. Pick one and go. Normally, asking the group a roman vote is an easy way to force a decision without the decision coming from the facilitator. This allows the facilitator to stay a facilitator instead becoming a decision-maker.

### Roman vote

Roman vote is a quick and easy way to get input from the entire team. Simply have everybody stick their fists out with their thumb up. If they agree, point their thumb up. If they disagree, put their thumb down. If they don't have strong feelings, they can put their thumb sideways. Either way, everybody votes, at the same time, all at once. Majority wins.

## Walking away

As a facilitator, one of your jobs is to make the team self-functioning. This means they can function without you there. If you are going to help them to function without you there, you can't do that while always being there. What you want to do is start adding little periods of time while you're not there so that they are used to you not always being there. Walk away to get something to drink. Have a conversation on your phone. Take an extra long bathroom break. When you come back, you notice the team slips a little bit. This is good. Get them back on course, then give them another chance to continue without you. Over time, you want to grow the periods when they are alone. Think of this as turning your team from kids to adults. You can't expect self-organized decision making if you always do decisions for them. You need to give them safe spaces to try, fail and succeed on stuff on their own.

Sometimes it is really hard not to step in when you are a facilitator. You know the right answer. And it kills you to stay silent. Walking away at these moments is a great solution.

Tip. Carry a refillable water bottle. This gives you an excuse to go refill it and will also remind you to go to the bathroom.

## Holding the space

Kids will play with their friends differently when they are home alone compared to when their parents are there. This is true even through in both situations they will not talk to their parents, but play by themselves. This concept is referred to in the facilitator-world as holding the space. If you do you set up the right habits and patterns, you can enforce them by your mere presence in the room.

This is not that surprising. But it can be hard to value holding the space. To realize that you are doing nothing but being present is something that you need to prioritize and give time to.
