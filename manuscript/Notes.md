Intentional programming
Non-programmers in the mob and ways of contributing
Adjusting chairs for different people
Long rotations / per task rotations
Designated navigator and navigating the navigator
The best of everyone, not the most of everyone.
Only one in the mob knows what to do - don't make that person drive.
Steps
1. Intention
2. Location
3. Keystrokes

Experience: It was fun, I learned a lot BUT.

Troubles:
  * Not having a designated navigator leaving one person to navigate all the time
  * Not having enough skilled navigators
  * Having a person in the mob that always opts to navigate
  * Driver doing thinking while typing
  * Not leaving room for less skilled navigators to contribute the easy bits
  * Disturbing the focus with complaints of not wanting to be there
