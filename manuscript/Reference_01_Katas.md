# Deliberate Practice
Development katas are simple exercises that we can do for the sake of practice.

## FizzBuzz
1,2,Fizz,4,Buzz,Fizz,7,8,Fizz,Buzz,11,Fizz,13,14,FizzBuzz  
Print the numbers from 1-100 replacing numbers divisible by 3 with Fizz, divisible by 5 with Buzz and both with FizzBuzz.

## Roman Numerals

  1. Given a number, convert it to a roman numeral.
  2. Given a roman numeral, convert it to a number.
  3. Program roman numeral addition, without allowing to convert to numbers in between.

## Games

  Most games make for good katas. Here are a few of our favorites

  1. Tic-Tac-Toe
  2. Battleship
  3. Minesweeper
  4. Bowling (score card)
  5. Blackjack
  6. Checkers/Chess
  7. Yahtzee
  8. Scrabble

## Checkouts

 Create a receipt and checkout program. Interesting pricing rules include

 1. Multiple items
 2. Discounts if 3 are purchased
 3. Discounts if 3 or more are purchased
 4. Weighable items (3.5 pounds of candy)
 5. Rates per ranges (0-1 lbs $5/lbs, 1-10 lbs $4 per lbs, 10+ 3$ per pound)
 6. Taxable items
 7. Buy one get one free promotions
 8. Combo Promotions ($5 off hotdogs & buns)

## Math

  Math problems are also fun.

  1. Triangles (perimeters, area, angles)
  2. Shortest route
  3. Integer Range (does 1-100 contain 65? overlap 50-200? contain 5-10?)
  4. Prime Factors
  5. Change Machine (which coin combinations to give for 55 cents)
  6. Game of Life
  7. Leap Year

## Words / Text

 1. Anagrams
 2. Secret Decoder Ring
 3. Word Wrap
 4. LCD numbers
 5. Natural Sort (1.txt,2.txt,10.txt,20.txt)
 6. Diamonds

## Exploratory Testing

### Test Target
 You can use any software, website application or electronic device to do an Exploratory Testing kata.
 Some of the qualities that make a good test target are:

 1. Understandable Domain (either common or team specific)
 2. Target rich - a fair amount of problems to find
 3. Small area to test
 4. GUI, API or Physical Interface

### Charter
 Choose a single charter for your Kata. Possible charters include:

 1. List Features while testing (Mindmap)
 2. Find Bugs & Questions
 3. Toolings (Bug magnet, Chrome Developer Tools, Burb Suite, etc...)
 4. Create tests scripts (Selenium, Cucumber, etc...)
 5. Create bug reports
 6. Thorough notetaking
 7. Test Planning (list possible areas and charters)
 8. Performance Testing
 9. Security Testing
 10. Enhancing Testability & Supportability
 11. Different Environment Testing
 12. Usability Testing (personas, Nielsen heuristics)
 13. Analysing logs
 14. Heuristics (SFDPOT, HICCUPS, etc...)

## Non-development
  Sometimes you want to practice mobbing in a non-technical setting.

### Writing
  Write a blog or an essay. Remember to outline (at minimum the paragraph you're working on) to keep everyone in sync.

## Other
  Any suggestion can make a good kata. Our rule is whoever suggested the kata becomes the product owner and is responsible for defining the user stories and prioritizing them.
