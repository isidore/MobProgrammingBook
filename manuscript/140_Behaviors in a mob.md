# Behaviors in a mob

When figuring out how to work better in a mob, here are some behaviors you could try practicing. This is inspired by [Willem Larsen's Mob Programming the Role Playing Game](https://github.com/willemlarsen/mobprogrammingrpg).

## Driver

   * Ask clarifying questions about what to type
   * Ask to be navigated on a different level of abstraction
   * Type something you disagree without
   * Use a new keyboard shortcut
   * Learn something about tooling
   * Ignore a direct instruction from someone who isn't the Designated Navigator
   * Amplify the unheard voice
   * Support contributions of a mobber with least privilege
   * Celebrate moments of excellence
   * Point out a long line of code
   * Point out unnecessary complexity
   * Point out duplication
   * Point out a misnamed variable or methods
   * Propose an action to improve the code

Drivers take on three roles: from being a Driver (intelligent input device) to Sponsor (supporting others from a unique position) to Nose (noticing things about the code).

## Designated Navigator

   * Ask for ideas
   * Filter the mob's ideas to tell the Driver exactly what to type
   * Tell the driver only your high-level intent and have them implement the details while you review them
   * Create a failing test, make it pass, refactor
   * Find and share relevant information from documentation
   * Find and share relevant information from a blog
   * Find and share relevant information from a coding forum
   * Point out a repeated task in a tool
   * Point out a repeated aspect of the team process
   * Point out possible unnecessary code
   * Propose an automation for a repeated tasks
   * Propose automating a repeated task
   * Take more than one idea from the other people in the mob and do both
   * Get and implement an idea from someone in the mob who has been quiet
   * Make a bad suggestion and ask people for options
   * Allow the choice of next action for the least privileged voice

Navigators take on four roles: from being a Navigator (translating ideas into code) to Researcher (having better information available) to Automationist (recognizing repetition) to Conductor (enhancing others contributions).

## Other Navigators

   * Make room for less privileged voice to be heard
   * Contribute an idea
   * Ask questions until you understand
   * Listen actively ready to pitch in when needed
   * Quietly speak into the navigators ear
   * Give the smallest cue necessary to move navigator forward through the problem
   * Navigate the navigator on highest level of abstraction they can successfully take through
   * Record solution alternatives on a whiteboard so they are not forgotten
   * Step on whiteboard to express an idea as it is taking shape
   * Articulate insights of current task at hand to make them visible for the mob

Other navigators can step in as Designated navigators any time, and this list includes some ideas of what they might try while not actively navigating the driver. Other navigators take on three roles: from Mobber (always contributing in different ways) to Rear Admiral (helping designated navigator do better and learn) to Archivist (improving team visibility).
